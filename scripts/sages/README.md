# SAGES

This is an implementation of an MMU compatible version of the Stellar Abundances and Galactic Evolution Survey (SAGES) DR1 dataset.

## Data preparation

Run the `download.py` script. This will download the catalog.

Run the `process.py` script. This will process the catalog and create the necessary files in the MMU format.

Both scripts take `--help` as an argument to show the available options.
